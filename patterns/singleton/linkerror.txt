Hi Professor Malloy,

I am working on the Project1. I'm getting Linker errors when I try compiling with the simple make file. Specifically, it throws errors when running the line below:

g++ -g -Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -pedantic -o run main.o MyDatabase.o

Error is:

/home/xxxxxxx/MySingletonProject1/MyDatabase.cpp:15: undefined reference to `MyDatabase::databaseInstance'

Can you please suggest what could be the issue? I have googled about this, but I have declared my methods in the header file and imported it correctly in main.cpp and MyDatabase.cpp.

Regards,
